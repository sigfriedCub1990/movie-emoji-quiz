# TODO:
- Add catch boundaries and redirects to handle error cases and invalid challenge routes
- Create Remix routes for /sign-in and /sign-out to use mounted Clerk components
- Use the Clerk User API to query the username for each user user-submitted challenge so you can give them credit for their cleverness
- Keep track of correct guesses and display an indicator in the UI so the user knows which challenges they have yet to tackle
- Use `react-hook-form` to simplify form validation?
